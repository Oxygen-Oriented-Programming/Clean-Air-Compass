## Vision

The vision of this site is to make a mapping interface and alert system for data from the open Purple Air network of citizen-run air quality sensors.

The pain point our site solves is that the current map provided by Purple Air only shows point location for each sensor and it would be helpful for a user to be able to access estimated air quality for their home or any other location in their area.  Additionally, the ability to access fine-grained alerts for air quality in their location allows users to make critical health safety decisions.

The public should care about this app because users with asthma or other pulmonary conditions would benefit greatly from more spatially accurate information about air quality. Scientists could also benefit from this app because it gives them away to quickly explore air quality data.
